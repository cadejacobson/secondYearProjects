<p> So, before we get into it, let me uh talk about a category of things.
The most advanced phones are called smart phones.
So they say. And they typically combine a phone plus some e-mail capability, plus they say it’s the Internet.
It’s sort of the baby Internet, into one device, and they all have these plastic little keyboards on them.
And the problem is that they’re not so smart and they’re not so easy to use, so if you kinda make a… Business School 101 graph of the smart axis and the easy-to-use axis, phones, regular cell phones are kinda right there, they’re not so smart, and they’re – you know – not so easy to use.
But smart phones are definitely a little smarter, but they actually are harder to use.
They’re really complicated.
Just for the basic stuff a hard time figuring out how to use them.
Well, we don’t wanna do either one of these things.
What we wanna do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use.
This is what iPhone is. OK?So, we’re gonna reinvent the phone.
Now, we’re gonna start… with a revolutionary user interface.. is the result of years of research and development, and of course, it’s an interplay of hardware and software.
Now, why do we need a revolutionary user interface? I mean, Here’s four smart phones, right? Motorola Q, the BlackBerry, Palm Treo, Nokia E62 – the usual suspects.
And, what’s wrong with their user interfaces? Well, the problem with them is really sort of in the bottom 40 there. It’s, it’s this stuff right here.
They all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not to be there.
And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic and are the same for every application.
Well, every application wants a slightly different user interface, a slightly optimized set of buttons, just for it.
And what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now? You can’t run around and add a button to these things.
They’re already shipped. So what do you do? It doesn’t work because the buttons and the controls can’t change.
They can’t change for each application, and they can’t change down the road if you think of another great idea you wanna add to this product.
