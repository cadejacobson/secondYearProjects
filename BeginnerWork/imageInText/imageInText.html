<div class="clip-text clip-text_one"> So, before we get into it, let me uh talk about a category of things.
The most advanced phones are called smart phones.
So they say. And they typically combine a phone plus some e-mail capability, plus they say it’s the Internet.
It’s sort of the baby Internet, into one device, and they all have these plastic little keyboards on them.
And the problem is that they’re not so smart and they’re not so easy to use, so if you kinda make a… Business School 101 graph of the smart axis and the easy-to-use axis, phones, regular cell phones are kinda right there, they’re not so smart, and they’re – you know – not so easy to use.
But smart phones are definitely a little smarter, but they actually are harder to use.
They’re really complicated.
Just for the basic stuff a hard time figuring out how to use them.
Well, we don’t wanna do either one of these things.
What we wanna do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use.
This is what iPhone is. OK?So, we’re gonna reinvent the phone.
Now, we’re gonna start… with a revolutionary user interface.. is the result of years of research and development, and of course, it’s an interplay of hardware and software.
Now, why do we need a revolutionary user interface? I mean, Here’s four smart phones, right? Motorola Q, the BlackBerry, Palm Treo, Nokia E62 – the usual suspects.
And, what’s wrong with their user interfaces? Well, the problem with them is really sort of in the bottom 40 there. It’s, it’s this stuff right here.
They all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not to be there.
And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic and are the same for every application.
Well, every application wants a slightly different user interface, a slightly optimized set of buttons, just for it.
And what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now? You can’t run around and add a button to these things.
They’re already shipped. So what do you do? It doesn’t work because the buttons and the controls can’t change.
They can’t change for each application, and they can’t change down the road if you think of another great idea you wanna add to this product.
Well, how do you solve this?
Hmm. It turns out, we have solved it!
We solved it in computers 20 years ago. We solved it with a bit-mapped screen that could display anything we want. Put any user interface up. And a pointing device. We solved it with the mouse. Right?
We solved this problem. So how’re we gonna take this to a mobile device?
What we gonna do is get rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen.
A giant screen.
Now, how are we gonna communicate this? We don’t wanna carry around a mouse, right?
So what are we gonna do? Oh, a stylus, right?
We’re gonna use a stylus.
No. No. Who wants a stylus?
You have to get em and put em away, and you lose em. Yuck.
Nobody wants a stylus. So let’s not use a stylus.
We’re gonna use the best pointing device in the world. We’re gonna use a pointing device that we’re all born with – we’re born with ten of them. We’re gonna use our fingers.
We’re gonna touch this with our fingers. And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch, which is phenomenal.
It works like magic.
You don’t need a stylus. It’s far more accurate than any touch display that’s ever been shipped.
It ignores unintended touches, it’s super-smart.
You can do multi-finger gestures on it.
And boy, have we patented it.
So, so we have been very lucky to have brought a few revolutionary user interfaces to the market in our time.
First was the mouse.
The second was the click wheel.
And now, we’re gonna bring multi-touch to the market.
And each of these revolutionary user interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product – the Mac, the iPod and now the iPhone.
So, a revolutionary user interface.
We’re gonna build on top of that with software. Now, software on mobile phones is like is like baby software.
It’s not so powerful, and today we gonna show you a software breakthrough. Software that’s at least five years ahead of what’s on any other phone.
Now how do we do this? Well, we start with a strong foundation: iPhone runs OSX.
Now, why, why would we wanna run such a sophisticated operating system on a mobile device? Well, because it’s got everything we need.
It’s got multi-tasking.
It’s got the best networking.
It already knows how to power manage. We’ve been doing this on mobile computers for years. It’s got awesome security.
And the right apps.
It’s got everything from Cocoa and the graphics and it’s got core animation built in and it’s got the audio and video that OSX is famous for.
It’s got all the stuff we want.
And it’s built right into iPhone. And that has let us create desktop class applications and networking, right.
Not the crippled stuff that you find on most phones. This is real, desktop-class applications.
Now, you know, one of the pioneers of our industry, Alan Kay, has had a lot of great quotes throughout the years. And I ran across one of them recently that explains how we look at this.
Explains why we go about doing things the way we do, cause we love software.
And here’s the quote: “People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.”
You know, Alan said this 30 years ago, and this is how we feel about it.
And so we’re bringing breakthrough software to a mobile device for the first time.
It’s five years ahead of anything on any other phone.
The second thing we’re doing is we’re learning from the iPod, syncing with iTunes.
You know, we’re gonna ship our 100 millionth iPod this year, and that’s a lo… 10s of millions of people that know how to sync these devices with their PCs or Mac and sync all of their media right on to their iPod.
Right?
So you just drop your iPod in, and it automatically syncs.
You’re gonna do the same thing with iPhone. It automatically syncs to your PC or Mac right through iTunes.
And iTunes is gonna sync all of your media onto your iPhone: Your music, your audio books, podcasts, movies, TV shows, music videos.
But it also syncs a ton of data: Your contacts, your calendars and your photos, which you can get on your iPod today, your notes, your..your bookmarks from your Web browser, your e-mail accounts, your whole e-mail set-up. All that stuff can be moved over to your iPhone completely automatically.
It’s really nice.
And we do it, we do it through iTunes.
Again, you go to iTunes and you set it up. Just like you’d set up an iPod or an Apple TV. And you set up what you want synced to your iPhone. And it’s just like an iPod. Charge and sync. So sync with iTunes.

Third thing I wanna talk about a little is design.
We’ve designed something wonderful for your hand, just wonderful.
And this is what it looks like.
It’s got a three-and-a-half-inch screen on it. It’s really big.
And, it’s the highest-resolution screen we’ve ever shipped. It’s 160 pixels per inch.
Highest we’ve ever shipped. It’s gorgeous.
And on the front, there’s only one button down there.
We call it the home button. Takes you home from wherever you are.
And that’s it. Let’s take a look at the side.
It’s really thin. It’s thinner than any smart phone out there, at 11.6 millimeters.
Thinner than the Q, thinner than the BlackJack, thinner than all of them.
It’s really nice.
And we’ve got some controls on the side, we’ve got a little switch for ring and silent, we’ve got a volume up and down control.
Let’s look at the back.
On the back, the biggest thing of note is we’ve got a two-megapixel camera built right in.
The other side, we’re back in the front.
So let’s take a look at the top now.
We’ve got a headset jack. 3 and half millimeter all your iPod headphones fit right in.
We’ve got a place, a little tray for your SIM card, and we’ve got one switch for sleep and wake. Just push it to go to sleep, push it to wake up.
Let’s take a look at the bottom.
We’ve got a speaker, we’ve got a microphone, and we’ve got our 30-pin iPod connector.
So that’s the bottom.

Now, we’ve also got some stuff you can’t see.
We’ve got three really advanced sensors built into this phone. 
The first one is a proximity sensor. It senses when physical objects get close, so when you bring iPhone up to your ear, to take a phone call, it turns off the display, and it turns off the touch sensor, instantly.
Well, why do you wanna do that?
Well, one to save battery, but two, so you don’t get spurious inputs from your face into the touch screen.
Just automatically turns them off, take it away, boom, it’s back on.
So it’s got a proximity sensor built in.
It’s got an ambient light sensor, as well. We sense the ambient lighting conditions and adjust the brightness of the display to match the ambient lighting conditions.
Again, better user experience, saves power.
And the third thing we’ve got is an accelerometer, so that we can tell when you switch from portrait to landscape. It’s pretty cool. Show it to you in a minute. So three advanced sensors built in.

So, let’s go ahead and turn it on.
This is the size of it. It fits beautifully in the palm of your hand.
So, an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator.
Let’s start with the iPod. You can touch your music.
You can just touch your music, it’s so cool.
You’ve got a widescreen video.
You can find your music even faster.
Gorgeous album art on this display.
Built-in speaker, and, why not? Cover flow. First time ever on an iPod.
So rather than talk about this some more, let me show it to you.
Alrighty.
Now, I’ve got some special – some special – iPhones up here, they’ve got a little special board in them so I can get some digital video out, and I’ve got a little cord here which goes up to these projectors, and uh so I’ve got some great images, and you get to see what it really looks like.
So, let me, I’ve got a camera here so you can see what I’m doing with my finger for a few second.
And uh let me go ahead and get that picture within picture up.
I’m gonna go ahead and just push the sleep/wake button and there we go, right there.
And to unlock the phone I just take my finger and slide it across.
Want to see that again? Sleep.
We wanted something you couldn’t do by accident in your pocket.
Just slide it across. Boom.
And this is the home screen of iPhone right here.
And so if I want to get in the iPod, I just go down to that lower right hand corner and push this icon right here, and boom, I’m in the iPod.
I wanna get home, I push the home button right here, and I’m home.
Back in the iPod. I am back in the iPod.
Now, here I am you see five buttons across he bottom.
Playlists, artists, songs, videos and more. I’m in artists right now.
Well, how do I scroll through my lists of artists?
How do I do this? I just take my finger, and I scroll.
That’s it. Isn’t that cool?
A little rubber banding up when I run off the edge.
And if I wanna pick somebody, let’s say I wanna pick the Beatles, I just tap them, and here’s the Beatles songs with their albums right here.
If I wanna play Sgt. Pepper’s I just hit Sgt. Pepper’s right there, and uh “A Little Help From My Friends.” 
Look at this gorgeous album artwork here.
Of course, I’ve got a volume control.
Now, I’ve got a little button up in the corner right here, you can see in the upper right-hand corner, I can hit that and flip the album art around.
There’s all the other songs back here.
And I can play “Lovely Rita” if I want to.
Flip it back around. Very simple.
Right, I can set some stars back here just by setting the arrows. Right?
That’s a five star album. Isn’t that cool? Yeah, it’s pretty nice.

Now, let me show you something else.
I just take my unit here, and I turn it landscape mode, oh, look what happens!
I’m in cover flow.
Let’s go into Dylan here, let’s play “Like a Rolling Stone.”
I just thumb through, just thumb through my albums.
It’s really easy.
Anytime I find something I like, I can just turn it around, and play something.
It’s that easy.
It’s that simple.
Isn’t that great? Yeah.
Alright. I could play with this for a long time.

Now, Again, I’ve got playlists here.
I can go into my playlists. I’ve got artists. I’ve got songs.
Uh I’ve got more over here. I’ve got you know – albums.
I’ve got a great album view again that shows all my album artwork right here if I want.
uh And uh I’ve also got audio books and compilations and things like that.
I’ve also got videos here.
So I push videos and uh I’ve got here i’ve got a podca.. video podcast loaded on, and a music video.
And I’ve got a TV show and a movie, and I’d like you to just show the uh TV show here. This is an episode from The Office. All videos we look at in uh.. in landscape.

We have touch controls on here, of course.
Isn’t that awesome? Isn’t that awesome?
Let’s go.

Now I wanna show you uh a movie playing. Let’s play Pirates of the Caribbean, the second one, here.
Great movie, by the way.
Now this is a widescreen movie so I just double-tap and I can see the whole thing here, or I can fill up the screen, whichever I like.

And again, I’ve got on-screen controls here. Isn’t this cool?
So we can be watching feature-length movies just like this.
Alrighty. So that – is the iPod.
Pretty cool, huh? 
We’ve just started. So again, touch your music. 
scroll through your songs, scroll through your playlists.
It’s incredible. Widescreen video like you’ve never seen on a portable device, 160 pixels per inch, gorgeous screen quality.
Gorgeous album art, and cover flow.
It’s the best iPod we’ve ever made.
Again, some of the screen shots. It’s unbelievable.
Here’s some album art I just put up, so you can see what it looks like.
Just, no matter what you like, it looks pretty doggone gorgeous.
And of course, cover flow and video, with on-screen controls.[0:48:28]

You know, I was showing this to somebody –
I was giving a demo to somebody a little while ago, who had never seen this before, inside Apple. And I uh finished the demo, I said what do you think.
He told me this, he said, you had me at scrolling.
So, the iPhone with the most amazing iPod ever.
You can now touch your music.

So that’s the iPod.
Now, let’s take a look at a revolutionary phone.
We wanna reinvent the phone.
Now, what’s the killer app?
The killer app is making calls!
It’s amazing, it’s amazing how hard it is to make calls on most phones.
Most people actually dial them every time.
Most people don’t have very many numbers in their address book they use their recents as their address book. Right?
How many of you do that? I bet more than a few.
So, we wanna let you use contacts like never before.
You can sync your iPhone with your PC or Mac and bring down all your contacts right into your phone. So you’ve got everybody’s numbers with you at all times. 
We have something that’s going to revolutionize voice mail today. We call it visual voice mail.
Wouldn’t it be great – if you didn’t – if you had six voice mails if you didn’t have to listen to five of them first before you wanted to listen to the sixth?
Wouldn’t that be great if you had random access voice mail? 
Well, we’ve got it. Just like e-mail you can go directly to the voice mails that interest you. Excellent audio audio quality. iPhone is a quad-band, GSM plus Edge phone.
We have decided, we decided, to go with the most popular international standard, which is GSM. We’re on that bandwagon, headed on that roadmap, and uh plan to make 3G phones and all sorts of other amazing things in the future. So, quad-band GSM plus edge, and of course we have wi-fi and Bluetooth 2.0 EDR built in, as well.

[0:50:36]

And so this is what it looks like when you get a call.
This is what it sounds like. It’s one of our ring tones, you can pick of course.

So, I wanna show you four things.
I wanna show you the phone app, photos, got a calendar, and SMS messaging.
The kind of things you would find on a typical phone, but in a very untypical way now.
So let’s go ahead and take a look.
So let’s go to our phone, first.
You see that uh icon in the lower left-hand corner, the phone?
I just push it right here, and boom, I’m in the phone.
And I’ve got five buttons across the bottom: favorites, recents, contacts, keypad and voice mail. I’m in contacts, right now, again. How do I move around my contacts?
I just scroll through them.
And so, let’s say I wanna make a call to Jony Ive.
I can just push here, and I see Jony Ive’s context, with all his information: his three phone numbers, his e-mail, whatever else, his address, whatever else I’ve got.
It’s all in one place.
And if I wanna call Jony, all I do is push his phone number. I’ll call his mobile number right now. And now, we are calling Jony here.

Hey, Jony, how you doing?
Well, it’s been 2 and a half years, and I.. I can’t tell you how thrilled I am to make the first public phone call with iPhone.
I… I remember when we first started working on this, and it’s.. it’s just unbelievable. Wah, whoa, what is this? I’ve got another call coming in. Jony, can I put you on hold for a minute? Ok. So I put Jony on hold and …

Hi Phil.
[Schiller says: Hey, Steve, I wanted to be the first call!”]

Sorry Phil! As you can see, it’s pu.. put Jony on hold, and Phil, I can just touch Jony and bring Jony back. Hey, Jony are you there?
Hey listen, uh Phil called. Do you mind if I conference him in?

[“I guess so,” Ive says]

You can see the m.. uh button has changed to merge calls right there in the middle, so I just push that right here, and now, I’ve created a conference call.
Jony, you there? Phil, you there?

So here we are, and uh listen I gotta get back to my keynote, so uh if I wanna do that, what i’m gonna.. I just touch this arrow right here, and uh I’m gonna go ahead and take Jony private here and uh put Phil on hold. Jony, do you have anything to say on the first phone call?
