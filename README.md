# secondYearProjects
For more information about me as a person, check out my base repository's readme!

This is a repository for the projects I make in my second year of college. I realized quickly in my time at my first internship
that no amount of bad frontend code can make up for a beautiful back-end. Seeing as I do much of my classwork and part
of my first internship on the backend side of the code, I figured practicing the design of the frontend can only
make me a stronger, more well rounded developer as a whole. Check out my progress here!

I would recommend checking out secondYearProjects/beginnerWork/imageInText for an introduction to my HTML/CSS.
